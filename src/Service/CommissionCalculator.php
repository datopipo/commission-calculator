 * Commission Calculator Service
 * 
 * This service calculates commission fees for financial operations based on:
 * - Operation type (deposit/withdraw)
 * - User type (private/business)
 * - Amount and currency
 * - Weekly operation history for private users
 * 
 * Commission Rules:
 * - Deposit: 0.03% of amount
 * - Business Withdraw: 0.5% of amount
 * - Private Withdraw: 0.3% of amount, with free conditions:
 *   - First 3 operations per week
 *   - Up to 1000 EUR per week
 * 
 * All amounts are converted to EUR for calculations and back to original currency for output.
 * Commission is rounded up to the currency's smallest unit (2 decimal places for EUR/USD, 0 for JPY).
